    Enhancement of the negamax with alpha-beta and memoization that leverages the use of the computation
    table to speed up execution by solving smaller subproblems first. The algorithm searches the tree at a depth

    using the table to avoid recomputing the smaller subproblems keeping track of the best move at each iteration. The
    implementation is based on the description of iterative deepening from https://www.chessprogramming.org/Iterative_Deepening.

    the current best move when the time limit is reached or when the tree has been searched to the specified depth.
